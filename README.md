# MiniDL

As well known, Python is good in writing code, CXX is good in performance.

But actually, CXX is also good in writing code while we use imperative mode.

Here, we build a CXX imperative training and inference interface with operator kernels in tensorflow which is validated widely.

# TODO
0. GPU support
1. models save/load
2. support DLPack
3. Multi-Device support
